# CoupleSync

CoupleSync.ai is a relationship-intelligence tool that uses large language model (LLM) prompts to help partners gain insight into themselves and each other. It generates detailed psychological profiles, a combined relationship profile, and provides ongoing AI coaching.

## Features

- **Individual Profiles** – Each partner answers a guided questionnaire produced by an LLM. The resulting psychological profile covers personality, emotional tendencies, coping mechanisms and more.
- **Couple Profiles** – The two individual profiles are synthesized into a single report describing strengths, tension points, communication dynamics and growth suggestions.
- **AI Coaching** – With both individual and relationship profiles, an AI coach can deliver personalized guidance for navigating conflict, deepening intimacy and achieving shared goals.

## How It Works

1. **Generate Individual Profiles**
   - Copy the `Individual Prompt` from `index.html` into your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Meta AI, etc.).
   - The LLM walks each partner through 74 questions and then outputs a structured psychological profile. These profiles form the basis of all further work.
2. **Create Your Relationship Profile**
   - Copy the `Couple Prompt` from the webpage and paste it into the LLM.
   - When prompted, provide both individual profiles. The LLM analyzes them together and produces a detailed CoupleSync relationship profile.
3. **Begin AI Coaching**
   - Copy the `Coaching Prompt` and paste it into the LLM. Provide both psychological profiles and the relationship profile.
   - You now have a context-aware AI coach that can respond 24/7 with tailored advice.

## The Science Behind CoupleSync

Understanding how you and your partner operate is a key predictor of relationship satisfaction. CoupleSync relies on principles from personality psychology, attachment theory and evidence-based communication strategies.

- **Self-knowledge** – Research shows that insight into one’s own personality and emotional patterns improves emotional regulation and relationship satisfaction.
- **Partner Understanding** – Accurately perceiving a partner’s needs and traits is linked to empathy and secure attachment.
- **Relationship Dynamics** – By combining both profiles, couples can see how their patterns interact, revealing strengths to build on and blind spots to address.
- **Ongoing Coaching** – Continuous prompts and check-ins encourage new habits, constructive conversations and growth over time.

CoupleSync is not therapy, but it provides structured reflection and concrete suggestions to help couples communicate more effectively and foster intimacy.
