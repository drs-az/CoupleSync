      <h4>Getting Started</h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1: Generate Individual Profiles</strong><br/>
      Copy the Individual Prompt into your preferred LLM—choose one of:
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>,
      <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a>,
      <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude</a>,
      <a href="https://ai.meta.com" target="_blank">Meta AI</a>,
      or <a href="https://x.com/grok" target="_blank">Grok</a>.
      The LLM will ask each partner a series of questions and, at the end, produce a detailed psychological profile. Take your time with this process. The profiles will serve as the foundation of the relationship profile and the ongoing AI coaching.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Step 2: Create Your Relationship Profile</strong><br/>
      Working together, copy the Couple Prompt into your LLM. Keep both individual profiles handy—you’ll be asked to paste them. After pasting the individual profiles when prompted, the LLM will output your CoupleSync relationship profile.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Start Coaching</strong><br/>
  Copy the Coaching Prompt into your LLM on your device. Paste your individual profiles and your relationship profile into the chat. You now have a fully informed, 24/7 AI relationship coach ready with actionable advice.</p>
